Potential other tests

Test Other Fields: Include assertions for other texture paths (so_texture, we_texture, ea_texture),
 as well as the floor_color and ceiling_color, to ensure they are also being parsed correctly.

Test Map Layout: Verify that the map layout (tiles) is being parsed and stored correctly
 in the t_map structure.

Memory Leak Check: Use tools like Valgrind to run your tests and check for memory leaks.
 This will help ensure that all memory allocated during parsing and throughout the lifetime
  of your program is being freed correctly.

Automated Test Suite: If you plan on expanding your test cases, consider using a testing 
framework to automate the process, making it easier to run a suite of tests with various 
inputs and checking a range of assertions.
